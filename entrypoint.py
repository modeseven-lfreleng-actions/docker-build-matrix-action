"""Composite action entry point, run by path under ``python3 -I``.

Isolated mode keeps the working directory, which holds the repository
under test, and every ``PYTHON*`` variable off ``sys.path``. Under
``python3 -m``, the working directory comes first, so a repository
carrying its own ``scripts/discover.py`` would run in place of this
action. Here the only import root is the action's own directory,
added explicitly from this file's location.
